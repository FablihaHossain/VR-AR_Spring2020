	<div>
		<p class = "description"> This 3D scene represents my home country: Bangladesh! We have the national flag, waving in the wind, with a prayer mat in front of it. This symbolizes the national religion of Islam. In addition to that, the national animal of the country is the Bengal Tiger. It is currently admiring the flag. The animation for this project is with the cricket ball and bat 3D models, which is a very popular sport in the country. </p>

	<div>
		<p class = "description"> This assignment uses four different types of AR markers, paired with objects. The first one is the marker of the halo emoji and attached is a 3D model of the heart eyes emoji. I created the model myself with the help of the Tinkercad Site. The second marker is a memoji of myself and it currently has my name in 3D text and a box with the my linkedin QR code.The last two markers are QR codes of my linkedin and my instagram. Both are currently have an a-link element attached to them. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to get further into the links because there wasn't a simple way to click onto them. </p>
