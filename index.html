	<h1> Assignment One: Joy Bangla </h1>
		<p> This 3D scene represents my home country: Bangladesh! We have the national flag, waving in the wind, with a prayer mat in front of it. This symbolizes the national religion of Islam. In addition to that, the national animal of the country is the Bengal Tiger. It is currently admiring the flag. The animation for this project is with the cricket ball and bat 3D models, which is a very popular sport in the country. </p>
